//! Sends "Hello, world!" through the ITM port 0
//!
//! **IMPORTANT** Not all Cortex-M chips support ITM. You'll have to connect the
//! microcontroller's SWO pin to the SWD interface. Note that some development
//! boards don't provide this option.
//!
//! ITM is much faster than semihosting. Like 4 orders of magnitude or so.
//!
//! You'll need [`itmdump`] to receive the message on the host plus you'll need
//! to uncomment the `monitor` commands in the `.gdbinit` file.
