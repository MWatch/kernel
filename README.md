# Building

- Requires the `thumbv7em-none-eabi` target to be installed, use `rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabi` to do so.
- Requires `cargo-binutils` for extra features, such as generating a stripped binary. Note: The `llvm-tools-preview` component must be installed with `rustup component add llvm-tools-preview` for it to work.
